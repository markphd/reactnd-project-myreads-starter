This app handles two views, the Main page which contains the `<BookShelf>` component that is reponsible in listing books on shelf and the Search page where user input is accepted as query to `BooksAPI` search function. Each view uses `<Book>` component that renders properties of Book object, attached to this component is the `<ShelfChanger>` component that listens to change event when user change the book shelf.
